How to play:

All players must be in the voice chat name "General".
Type "!start" to start the game.
Type "!done" when talking is done and ready to vote.
 (votes are not anonymous for now.)
 
Person with the most votes will be selected as the liar.
If the selected member is the liar, liar gets a chance to guess the word.
If the liar gets the word, liar wins.
If people fail to vote out the liar, the liar wins.
Otherwise, citiznes win.

Notes: it is set that each player can only vote once.
Will add any updates here.
