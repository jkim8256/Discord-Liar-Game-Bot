# discord-liar-game-bot

# How to play:

# all players must be in the voice chat name "General"
# type "!start" to start the game
# type "!done" when talking is done and ready to vote.
#   (votes are not anonymous for now.)
 
# person with the most votes will be selected as the liar.
# if the selected member is the liar, liar gets a chance to guess the word.
# if the liar gets the word, liar wins.
# if people fail to vote out the liar, the liar also wins,
# otherwise, citiznes win.

# Notes: it is set that each player can only vote once.
# Will add any updates here.
